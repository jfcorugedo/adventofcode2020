# Advent of Code 2020 challenges

This is just all the answers I've been working on during the event of [Advent of Code, 2020 edition](https://adventofcode.com/2020/about).

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.

In my case I chose JS to solve all the challenges.

Each puzzle is in its own folder. Each folder represents a day.

Inside each day, there is always an `input.js` file with the dataset you need to use in order to solve the puzzle.

In addition, each puzzle has two different parts. There are always two folders: `part1` and `part2` inside each day with the instructions and question you need to solve to complete that part.

Finally, to help you achieve your goal, there is also a `sample.js` file inside each part with a small sample dataset to test your implementation.
```
/src
  |
  |
   -/Day1...
   |
    -/part1
    -/part2
    -input.js
   -/Day2...
```
Just go over each puzzle and try to solve the problem using a test suite written in Jest.

Enjoy!!
